This is the repository for code used in the paper
- DÃ¹, R.S., Smith, K.S. , 2024. *Emergent vorticity asymmetry of one and two-layer shallow water system captured by a next-order balanced model*.

It contains:

The code for the simulation of the freely-decay dynamics of balanced shallow water turbulence under the full one-layer shallow water model and the SWQG<sup>+1</sup> model. 

The code for the simulation of the evolution of a baroclinically unstable jet in two-layer shallow water and the SWQG<sup>+1</sup> model.
